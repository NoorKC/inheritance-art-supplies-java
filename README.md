# 🖌️ Inheritance Demo: Art Supplies in Java

A fun and educational Java project that demonstrates **inheritance and polymorphism** using art supplies like paintbrushes and pencils as real-world objects.

## 🧬 Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class inheritance and method overriding
- Abstract thinking using real-world analogies

## 📦 File Overview

- `ArtSupply.java`: The base class for all art tools
- `Paintbrush.java`: A subclass with unique behavior
- `Pencil.java`: Another subclass with its own traits
- `Main.java`: Runs the program and demonstrates polymorphism in action

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open the project in a Java IDE (e.g. IntelliJ or Eclipse)
2. Run `Main.java`
3. Watch how different objects share structure but behave uniquely — art with code ✨

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This project is perfect for beginners learning:
- How to design class hierarchies
- When to use `extends`
- How subclasses inherit and override methods
